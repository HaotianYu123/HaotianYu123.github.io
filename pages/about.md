#### Data Engineer & Analyst (Research & Development Data) –Li Auto         

|Location      |      Time/Date           |
| ---------------------- |:--------------------------:|
|Beijing,China |      August 2021 - Present
| ---------------------- |:--------------------------:|

         He managed data-driven projects for the R&D department of China's 
         leading electric vehicle company, Nasdaq: Li.

•	Signal Processing & Data Warehousing: Built data pipeline and ETL on ODS data 
from car end CANLOG signals, SOA signals and software telemetry to cloud, and 
processed ODS data to extract features, capturing usage condition characteristics, 
time-domain features, frequency-domain condition features, and problem features, 
etc, and stored them in data warehouses, then to data mart using Scala Apache Spark 
and Pyspark. Eventually, he automated real-time/batch-processed data-driven reports 
using Python Streamlit and deployed them to vehicle engineers in order to improve 
vehicle IVDP (Intelligent Vehicle Development Process). 
Optimized data warehousing and SQL queries, resulting in a 25% increase in 
performance tuning and a 10% decrease in spark job failure rate. 
Solved data-skewed problems on optimizing partitions. 

•	NLP/Labeling: Labeled data from work orders (TS, CPS, CRM, etc.) and user feedback 
(from social media, user apps, beta testers, etc.). Trained models to classify issues 
as Functional Domain--Vehicle Functions--Minor Function Modules/Integration--Problem 
Nodes (Sensors/Transmitters/Actuators).

•	Modeling: 
1. Use XGBoost to build a predictive maintenance model that forecasts when a machine
   is likely to fail based on historical data, and our team could perform maintenance
   before a breakdown occurs.
2. Data Mining project: Use signal data from existing sensors to further mine potential
   signal data and replace 10% of the sensor cost.
3. He designed and developed models to identify functional failures and performance
   issues in the cockpit interface, key connections, Bluetooth and door-lock modules and Wi-Fi key
   connections on Li L9/ L8. The model has reached an accuracy of 95%, and it has been
   stored on the car end as a DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code). Details of each issue will
   be sent to the corresponding customer service team and guide them to have the
   parts replaced;
4. Designed and implemented various metrics based on self-drive vehicle systems (ADAS),
    wipers, cockpit interfaces, and phone keys with Bluetooth. Participated in metrics
   alert project, when metrics reached an alert number, an alert message will be sent to
   the responsible engineers and customer service team to catch their attention.
6. Production Line Issues:
   Addressed Bluetooth calibration and door welding issues on the vehicle assembly line.
   Utilized data from the vehicle inspection line to analyze optimal calibration values
   for Bluetooth connections, capacitive triggers, and command transmissions.

•	GPT: Created company’s own knowledge base bot, trained LLM model using 
open-sourced GPT 3.5 turbo model, built data modeling and input table description 
of various data sources in Langchain prompt; this project enhanced data analyst work 
efficiency and  information exchange. 

•	Automated Testing: Designed automated testing procedures for high and low-frequency 
keys and Bluetooth. Developed the code logic for the automated key test and deployed 
it on the company's platform, contributing to the R&D of the flagship MEGA MPV 
by Li Auto.

•	Automated product: 
1. Automated Air Conditioning: Based on data from different 
scenarios, external environments, and user air conditioning usage, XGBoost models 
were trained to predict the best sir condition sets for the best customers’ comfort. 
Personalized auto air-conditioning models can be pushed to vehicles via OTA. 
The model is Continuously optimized based on user feedback.
2. Automatic Windshield Wipers: 
Adapted wiper speed outputs personalized to users, based on their usage and varying
rainfall conditions.

         Interface Products: Python, JAVA, txt, Alibaba Cloud, MySQL, Linux

•	Researched machine learning and deep learning algorithms for fatigue recognition 
and attention level identification based on single-channel EEG data and conducted 
data analysis.

•	Designed and wrote computer programs for fatigue and distraction guidance while 
utilizing the company's R&D hardware products to collect EEG data from 90 
participants, totaling 270 hours.

•	Applied filtering treatments to the frequency bands and wavelet analysis, extracting 
PSD (Power Spectral Density) post FFT from all participant's EEG data across the 5-50Hz 
frequency bands. Conducted feature engineering and performed PCA analysis on different 
algorithms to identify effective variables.

•	Based on collected wakefulness and fatigue data along with effective variables, 
carried out machine learning methods (trials included Support Vector Machines (SVM), 
Random Forest (RF), Relevance Vector Machines (RVD), LSTM, etc.) for fatigue and 
attention classification. Achieved a 92% accuracy rate for fatigue identification.
Applied deep learning (Cascade-NN and GAN) and achieved an 86% accuracy rate.

•	Led the algorithm team to achieve Top 15 rankings in two Brain-Computer Interface 
competitions at the 2021 World Robot Competition.

•	Contributed to Invention Patent for Brain-Computer Interface Products and 
research paper "Identifying Mental Fatigue States of Construction Workers through BCI 
using Deep Learning Methods"， which is about Utilizing deep learning to identify 
whether construction workers are fatigued.
