#### <a name="researchbackground"></a>Research & Work Experience

Data Engineer & Analyst (Research & Development Data) –Li Auto      Beijing, China                   August 2021- Present 
He managed data-driven projects for the R&D department of China's leading electric vehicle company, Nasdaq: Li.
•	Signal Processing & Data Warehousing: Built data pipeline and ETL on ODS data from car end CANLOG signals and SOA signals to cloud, and processed ODS data to extract features, capturing usage condition characteristics, time-domain features, frequency-domain condition features, and problem features, etc, and stored them in data warehouses, then to data mart using Scala Apache Spark and Pyspark. Eventually, he automated real-time/batch-processed data-driven reports using Python Streamlit and deployed them to vehicle engineers in order to improve vehicle IVDP (Intelligent Vehicle Development Process). Optimized data warehousing and SQL queries, resulting in a 25% increase in performance tuning and a 10% decrease in spark job failure rate. Solved data-skewed problems on optimizing partitions. 
•	NLP/Labeling: Labeled data from work orders (TS, CPS, CRM, etc.) and user feedback (from social media, user apps, beta testers, etc.). Trained models to classify issues as Functional Domain - Vehicle Functions - Minor Function Modules/Integration - Problem Nodes (Sensors/Transmitters/Actuators).
•	Modeling: 
1. Use XGBoost to build a predictive maintenance model that forecasts when a machine is likely to fail based on historical data, and our team could perform maintenance before a breakdown occurs.
2. Data Mining project: Use signal data from existing sensors to further mine potential signal data and replace 10% of sensor cost.
3. He designed and developed models to identify functional failures and performance issues in low-frequency keys, Bluetooth and door-lock modules and Wi-Fi key connections on Li L9/ L8. The model has reached an accuracy of 95%, and it has been stored on the car end as a DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code). Details of each issue will be sent to the corresponding customer service team and guide them to have the parts replaced; 4. Designed and implemented various metrics based on self-drive vehicle systems (ADAS), wipers, and phone keys with Bluetooth. Participated in metrics alert project, when metrics reached an alert number, an alert message will be sent to the responsible engineers and customer service team to catch their attention. 5. Production Line Issues: Addressed Bluetooth calibration and door welding issues on the vehicle assembly line. Utilized data from the vehicle inspection line to analyze optimal calibration values for Bluetooth connections, capacitive triggers, and command transmissions.
•	GPT: Created company’s own knowledge base bot,  trained LLM model using open-sourced GPT 3.5 turbo model, built data modeling and input table description of various data sources in Langchain prompt; this project enhanced data analyst work efficiency and  information exchange. 
•	Automated Testing: Designed automated testing procedures for high and low-frequency keys and Bluetooth. Developed the code logic for the automated key test and deployed it on the company's platform, contributing to the R&D of the flagship MEGA MPV by Li Auto.
•	Automated product: 1. Automated Air Conditioning: Based on data from different scenarios, external environments, and user air conditioning usage, XGBoost models were trained to predict the best sir condition sets for the best customers’ comfort. Personalized auto air-conditioning models can be pushed to vehicles via OTA. The model is Continuously optimized based on user feedback. 2. Automatic Windshield Wipers: Adapted wiper speed outputs personalized to users, based on their usage and varying rainfall conditions.

•	Used NLP to get keywords from cases. Classified the cases and identified whether the case is misdemeanor or felony.
•	Applying features engineering and selection for the court records and arrest data. Analyzing by using PCA and T-Pot.
•	Creating models such as SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression to cover the selected features to predict defendants’ appearance in court based on existing information. Dealt with Missing data for the case record and compared different data models. Argued and discussed the data models, and then output prediction and calculated the accuracy.  
•	Evaluated the data model for 92% accuracy. 

Research: Algorithm Development for Social Network classification (GWU):	Sep 2019- Feb 2020
•	Research in Graph algorithm, SA model, and the theory of  Topology.
•	Applied the developed researched SA algorithm to classify for different accounts in social media according to the relationships of following between each account to find the groups in the social media network relationship. Separated the nodes in different sets by using K-Means and Did Union-find algorithm to classify the social media group.
•	Researched the similarity of the related degree and the features for all the nodes and did analysis for whether the developed algorithm works well after the useless noises of relationships are added. Made sure the algorithm is reasonable and reliable.
•	Run the algorithm on the dataset and evaluate the accuracy (based on different metrics). Found the best balance measurements of different similarities for the best accuracy. Evaluated run time to measure the utility and time complexity.
•	Increased the accuracy to 97.8% by modifying the algorithm and make the whole project efficient
