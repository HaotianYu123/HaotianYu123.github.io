#### What is R&D Data-Driven/Research and Development Data Analysis?

###### What does R&D data analysis do?

Data science is considered the sexiest job of the 21st century. 
Its essence is to extract useful truths from data and then explain them to leaders. 
As Shlomo Aragmon said: "Data science = statistician + programmer + storyteller + artist." 
Data analysis is the core application of data science.

With the development of 4G and 5G and the popularization of new internet platforms, 
humanity has entered the era of big data: "One foot has stepped into big data, and the 
other is about to land." From ordinary people's daily lives and social interactions to 
national strategic plans, everything has a significant relationship with big data. 
At this point, China's big data development has reached a world-leading level due to its 
population advantage and the hard work of every big data professional. The rise of big 
data has greatly facilitated the growth of various industries. Data analysis shines more 
and more in various fields and applications.

In the R&D of new energy vehicles, there will be various challenges. Especially in today's 
era, where user needs are diverse, technology develops rapidly, and the industry changes 
drastically, traditional R&D methods no longer meet the speed of automotive R&D and iteration. 
The future belongs to automated and intelligent R&D iterations.

R&D data analysis emerged in response to this era's demands and is a team with a contemporary 
mission.

###### Role and Positioning of Data Analysts

Firstly, analysts facilitate communication and cooperation with R&D personnel such as DRE. 
They offer more data-driven and automated technical support throughout the vehicle R&D and 
subsequent iterative update processes. They identify and refine issues from vast amounts of data, 
provide solutions, and prove the feasibility of these solutions. By collaborating with automotive 
R&D experts, traditional car research and development can take flight, achieving results that 
conventional methods cannot. Let the data speak!

Secondly, from a big data perspective, analysts provide more problem-solving approaches and 
possibilities. This is the foundation of R&D iteration and the basis for product innovation. 
Data is like soil, nurturing refined business analysis and intelligent algorithms.

###### Cockpit Data Analysis

Cockpit data analysis focuses on the R&D, quality, user experience, and other related aspects 
of the cockpit. It covers a wide range of areas. The cockpit surrounds the user and is a crucial 
component of product strength.

The intelligent cockpit is the closest connection between users and data analysis. Cockpit data 
analysis can most effectively understand user needs, enhance user experience, and increase user 
stickiness. Overall, cockpit data analysis can enhance users' purchasing intentions and indirectly 
boost sales.

Cockpit data analysis can offer effective data analysis results to address the current issue of
blindly piling up smart R&D features. It can achieve maximum effectiveness with the least cost.

###### The Future of Big Data Analysis in vehicle manufacturing

In the future new energy vehicle industry, and even the entire manufacturing industry, the advancement of big data is inevitable. Big data can make the entire business renewal faster, more efficient, and more accurate.

Top new energy companies are investing heavily in big data analysis to gain advantages in product reputation and intelligent experience in the future. As the competition in the entire industry becomes increasingly fierce, intelligent R&D based on big data will play a more significant role in improving efficiency, reducing costs, and promoting objectives.
